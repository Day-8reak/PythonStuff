Ok so:

    1. Is there a difference between lists and arrays in python?

First of all, there are 2 different types of arrays, one from the main python library and another from the numpy library.
The main library is more efficient, but the numpy one is more powerful, flexible, and easier to use. Point is you have to import
from either one or the other library to use arrays. Lists are just created when you do something like 

2. I'm still really confused about the enums. Like how do those create 
consts. And is that the reason the enum library exists or does it have other purposes

3. Still a little confused with slicing. How can i print an array or string backwards?
Yes, it's a bit weird tho:

# Reversing a string using slicing
my_string = "hello"
reversed_string = my_string[::-1]
print("Reversed string:", reversed_string)

# Reversing a list using slicing
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
reversed_list = my_list[::-1]
print("Reversed list:", reversed_list)



4. Can i get the specific letter in a string if it's in a lists
Yes, you can!

5. I can use operations like union on sets, can i use them on lists?
Set operations are only usable on sets, so you'll have to convert the lists into 
sets to turn them into variables
