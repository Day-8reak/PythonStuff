#modules are external files with cool functions we can use

# whenever we want to use a function from a external file we state the
# name of the file and then the function name
print(TuplesAndFunctions.needInputs("Hello"))



# to get a vast collection of python modules we can
# go to the python documentation official page, and then
# we can just look through the functions and how to use them
# there are also plenty of other 

# There are 2 types of modules: built-in and external
# built-in means you have access to them without any import statements
# external means they came with the installation of python
# to access external files you just import them, if we go on pycharm we can look through
# the lib folder to look through the functions



# what if we want to get a third party module?
# pip is a package manager to install, manage, and remove python packages
# 99.9% percent of the time we can install using pip, they'll give you the command js follow it
