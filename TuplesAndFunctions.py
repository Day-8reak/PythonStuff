# tuples are like lists, but they are immutable
# you signify a tuple by using ()
coordinatesHome = (0, 0)


# coordinates are a good example for tuples
# because you usually don't want to change co-ordinates


    #functions are like reusuable bits of code
def sayHello():
    print("Hello")
#Functions inside a function are indented

sayHello() # You "call a function" by writing the name of the function 
# and then () to indicate you're referring to the function


#Some functions also will have parameters (need certain inputs to run):
def needInputs(name):
        print("Your name is: " + name);


# sometimes we also want to have functions that return stuff
#
